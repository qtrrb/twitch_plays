### A simple and modular reimplementation of twitch plays in python

special thanks to [learndatasci](https://www.learndatasci.com/tutorials/how-stream-text-data-twitch-sockets-python/) from which I took the connection code and thanks to [aindanrwt](https://github.com/aidanrwt/twitch-plays/blob/master/lib/bot.py) as I read his code afterwards to see if I could improve mine

#### How to use:

Download the python file and add your oath token in the token variable, and your channel name in nickname and channel (do not remove the # in channel) 
Make sure you have the pip requirements installed before you run the program
